![Metal Arithmetic Screenshot](/screenshots/screen.jpeg?raw=true "Screenshot")

## Metal Compute Shader Calculator with SwiftUI

## Done
* Interface based on classic calculator and test pass through compute kernel
* Basic arithmetic functions with GPU (Metal Compute Kernel) and CPU (Synchronous):
  * Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* Feature set check to provide GPU capabilities to supported devices
* Creates disabled button view overlay
* Notifies user when using Metal to perform arithmetic

### TODO
* Unit Tests CPU vs GPU
* `sqrt`, `%` and `M` functions etc
* debug subtraction operation on GPU
